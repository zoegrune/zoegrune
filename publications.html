                Parties craft their campaign messages to mobilize diverse constituencies. Theories of election strategy find that parties choose their tactics dependent on their electoral context. However, analyses on the electoral consequences of party competition have only begun to explore the dependency between context and tactic. Building on theories of party competition, I predict that the broad electoral context, such as incumbent status or the state of the economy, decides the effect of electoral tactics on the votes parties receive. Parties benefit from branching out to a wider range of issues when they are in the opposition. Instead, government parties have less control of their reputation. Economic conditions limit the incumbent's ability to selectively construct its policy message. However, these parties profit from pairing down their policy appeals when the economy grows. Using evidence from the Comparative Manifestos Project for 24 OECD countries over a 60 year period, I find that conditioning party campaign messages on their economic environment demonstrates a clear and strong electoral impact. Individual level evidence from 12 OECD countries in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems adds evidence consistent with the underlying mechanism. Governing parties earn a reward for focusing their platforms when the economy grows more than the economy alone would predict. The results from this analysis complement a growing literature on the effect of parties' election tactics and help explain evidence that voters only respond to parties' election strategies.

            <h3>Dissertation</h3>

            <div class="publication">
                <strong>"Motivating Parliament: The Policy Consequences of Party Strategy"</strong><br><br>
                Scholars rarely consider the broader policy implications of party strategies. In my dissertation, I develop a theory linking party electoral strategy to government behavior and policy. In particular, I argue that parties strategically address issues to attract previously unmotivated voters and to maintain activist support. In government, parties then construct an image of accountability on these issues with each group by using legislative procedures as policy signals. This image of accountability with voters allows the government to focus on the goals of party activists because of the activists' proximity to the party organization and leadership. I empirically test propositions on party electoral strategy using data on electoral conditions and party platforms from the CMP in 24 OECD countries 1969-2008. I focus the analysis on the French Assemblée Nationale from 1978-2007, a most difficult case, to empirically test predictions for policy signals and the government's overall policy agenda using evidence from qualitative and quantitative sources. The empirical evidence indicates government policy tends to favor activist over voter policy goals.
